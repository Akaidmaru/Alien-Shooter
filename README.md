## About <a name = "about"></a>

Programming an Alien Shooter to practice Python and Pygame module based on Python
Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to download Pygame modules in order the game could be playable.

Pygame Install instructions:
1) Open CMD/Terminal
2) Type: pip install pygame

Once installed, you need to run the main file alien_invasion.py:

1) Open CMD/Terminal
2) Type: py alien_invasion.py


### Installing

No installing required, only the Pygame modules.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

When alien_invasion.py is open, you can move your ship that is located at the
bottom of the screen with left and right arrows. You can also shoot with 
spacebar.

Enemy aliens waves will come from the top of the screen, moving from right to left, once a enemy wave is cleared, other will pop up with increased speed.


## To-Do<a name = "to-do"></a>

- All-Time High Score needs to be saved, the high score right now resets each
time a player closes and restart the game.

- Refactoring some functions and methods.

- Maybe some updates like making Aliens to shoot bullets down.
Adding shields so the ship can hide behind and they can be destroyable from any side. 
- Adding some sfx.
